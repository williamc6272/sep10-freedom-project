## Content 
To brainstorm Part B, I reviewed all my research on forensic science technologies and wrote down the ideas that appeared most often, especially PCR and the Phenom SEM. I looked for patterns across my sources to decide which technologies were the most important to focus on. From there, I narrowed my list so my blog would stay clear and specific instead of trying to cover too much. After choosing my main points, I organized them in a way that explained what each technology does and how it helps forensic scientists. I then revised and edited my writing to make sure the information was accurate and easy to understand. Finally, I polished the content so it was ready for the website, and now I am moving on to creating a future innovation that could help improve the forensic science field even more.
## Engineering Design Process 
I am currently in the research and development stage of the engineering design process, where I am working on a [nanotech technologies](https://www.nano.gov/about-nanotechnology/) solution to help forensic scientists recover and restore broken or tampered evidence at crime scenes. After researching existing technologies like PCR and SEM, I identified how nanobots could enhance these capabilities by using specific frequencies to rebuild or highlight microscopic particles that are otherwise lost or degraded. These tiny robots could move through surfaces, detect hidden material, and use frequency-based signals to reorganize or illuminate evidence so it becomes usable again. I’ve also focused on solving challenges like degraded DNA, wiped surfaces, and faint trace evidence, while researching [eco friendly](https://www.ube.ac.uk/whats-happening/articles/sustainable-building-materials/)  materials to ensure the technology doesn’t harm the environment. My goal is to develop a realistic, future-ready design that improves how forensic evidence is collected and restored. Moving forward, in the concept refinement stage, I will collaborate more with my classmates to explore other designs, gain inspiration, and refine my own nanobot concept for practical use in forensic investigations. 

#### Creativity
**Creativity** played a major role when I designed my future innovation for the forensic science field. I imagined how nanotech robots could move through tiny spaces, detect hidden evidence, and restore it using specific frequencies. I used creative problem-solving to figure out how these robots would work without damaging the crime scene or the evidence itself. I also thought about ways to make the nanobots eco-friendly, such as using biodegradable materials and low-energy frequency systems. Overall, creativity helped me design a realistic and environmentally safe idea that could improve how forensic scientists recover evidence in the future.
#### Critical thinking
I used **critical thinking** to compare different forensic technologies and decide which ones were most important for my project. This helped me focus on tools like PCR and the Phenom SEM that are widely used in real investigations. When designing my nanotech robots, critical thinking allowed me to analyze how they could effectively restore evidence using frequencies without causing damage. I also evaluated different ways to make the robots eco-friendly and energy-efficient, weighing the benefits and challenges of each option. Overall, critical thinking guided both my research and design process, ensuring that my ideas were practical, realistic, and supported by evidence.
#### Problem solving
**Problem solving** was an important skill I used throughout my project. I identified challenges that forensic scientists face, such as degraded DNA or faint trace evidence, and thought about ways to address them. When designing my nanotech robots, I solved issues like how they could move through surfaces safely and restore evidence without causing damage. I also considered practical challenges, such as making the robots eco-friendly and energy efficient. Using **problem solving** helped me create a functional and realistic innovation that could improve forensic investigations in the future as many times I felt like quitting due to overthinking of a technology but I realized in reality i just need something that solves and design can be after this.
## Summary
In this project, I explored the technology used in forensic science and imagined how it could develop in the future. I researched current tools like PCR and the Phenom SEM to understand how evidence is collected and analyzed. Using critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, I designed a concept for nanotech robots that can restore evidence using specific frequencies while being eco-friendly. I also followed the engineering design process to ensure my idea was realistic and addressed real forensic challenges. Overall, this project helped me combine research, innovation, and planning to create a future-focused solution for forensic science.
