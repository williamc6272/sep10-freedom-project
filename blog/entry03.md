## Content 
To brainstorm Part B, I reviewed all my research on forensic science technologies and wrote down the ideas that appeared most often, especially PCR and the Phenom SEM. I looked for patterns across my sources to decide which technologies were the most important to focus on. From there, I narrowed my list so my blog would stay clear and specific instead of trying to cover too much. After choosing my main points, I organized them in a way that explained what each technology does and how it helps forensic scientists. I then revised and edited my writing to make sure the information was accurate and easy to understand. Finally, I polished the content so it was ready for the website, and now I am moving on to creating a future innovation that could help improve the forensic science field even more.
## Engineering Design Process 
For my engineering design process, I focused on creating a future innovation that could help forensic scientists recover damaged or hard-to-detect evidence. After learning how current technologies like PCR and SEM analyze microscopic material, I started thinking about what could push those abilities even further. My idea is to develop nanotechnology robots that can scan crime scenes and restore evidence by using specific frequencies to rebuild or highlight microscopic particles. In the brainstorming stage, I identified the main problems forensic scientists face, such as degraded DNA, wiped surfaces, and faint trace evidence. Then I designed a concept for tiny robots that could move through surfaces, detect hidden material, and use frequency-based signals to reorganize or illuminate evidence so it becomes usable again and came up with the plan to make these nanobots eco friendly. My goal in this stage is to make sure the design solves a real forensic problem, is realistic for future technology, and clearly improves how evidence is collected. As I continue the process, I will refine how the nanobots work, what materials they would use, and how forensic teams would safely operate them.
## Skills

#### Creativity
Working on this **Forensic Science** project and being in the research stage has strengthened my attention to detail because I have to be precise with my research and analyze scientific information in order to understand the problems there are and how technology work in order to solve these problems. In the forensic science field it is crucial to pay attention to every detail because small mistakes can alter cases, and similarly I have to precisely I have to understand what technologies such as the **Phenom SEM** and **Polymerase chain reaction** do and work. By paying attention to detail I have been able to learn how FOrensic scientists have to pay attention to every small details, and through my research I have been devloping learning and understanding on these technologies.
#### Critical thinking
**Critical thinking** played a major role when I designed my future innovation for the forensic science field. I had to come up with an idea of nano tech technology of AI to make nanotech robots and how nanotech robots could move through tiny spaces thanks to its size, detect hidden evidence, and restore it using specific frequencies. I used creative problem solving to figure out how these robots would work without damaging the crime scene or the evidence itself. I also thought about ways to make the nanobots ecofriendly, such as using biodegradable materials and low-energy frequency systems. Overall, creativity helped me design a realistic and environmentally safe idea that could improve how forensic scientists recover evidence in the future.
#### Problem solving
Problem solving was an important skill I used throughout my project. I identified challenges that forensic scientists face, such as degraded DNA or faint trace evidence, and thought about ways to address them. When designing my nanotech robots, I solved issues like how they could move through surfaces safely and restore evidence without causing damage. I also considered practical challenges, such as making the robots eco-friendly and energy efficient. Using problem-solving helped me create a functional and realistic innovation that could improve forensic investigations in the future as many times I felt like quitting due to overthinking of a technology but I realized in reality i just need something that solves and design can be after this.
