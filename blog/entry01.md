# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Forensic Science)
##### 10/18/21
## Choosing a topic
The topic I have decided on for this science is forensic science as I´ve always been amazed at uncovering and discovering new things. As someone who has a high desire to one day pursure this career its only right I would want to make a new kind of technology towards this topic. Though I had many ideas of what this project can be about such as being a medicine and cooking, I saw my passion lean more towards forensic science. Some of the pros I saw in these other topics was inside [Technology and the Future of Healthcare](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4147743/) where they explain how technology has developed medicine by creating antiobotics which save peoples lives every day as well as saving many lives each day. For cooking the website [Cooking with technology](https://ajeanneinthekitchen.com/2024/03/06/cooking-with-technology/) where technology has helped new tools like ovens and online classes for cooking to happen. What really catched my eye though was [The future of forensics: How AI can transform investigations](https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/news/ai-in-forensics/) by John Hopkins University where they show how crime has been reduced through technology. This made me have a broader perspective on the capabilities that technology can have in forensic science and how I feel more connected to forensic science.

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem but I have an idea of what I want to make and what the problem to be solved will be. **Many crime scenes have parts of the scene where things are destroyed** and this will be the problem, and the solution can be some sort of robots that can repair evidence at a crime scene. Though this may not be my final idea, the next step of researching my problem will help me assure what the problem will be. I plan on reading articles, and doing more research on the problem of forensic science. I also plan to speak with teachers and have discussions with others that have similar topics as me. 

## Skills 
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **Critical thinking** **Communication** and **Creativity**

#### Critical thinking
Working on this project has helped me developed the ability of critical thinking because i've learned to question my ideas, and expand my mind by seeing diffirent viewpoints of problems and solutions technology has with forensic science. Ive also learned to reflect on what I have learned to scenarios I may encounter in real life when I have a problem and how I can solve this problem.

#### Communication
Through my blog I have been able to learn communication and how to communicate with others. Though not many people have the same ideas I do, I use communication to talk to others of similarities we may have and compare our ideas and how we can make our ideas more stronger. I also have developed technology better because im able to explain my ideas better and how to present them better to other people.

#### Creativity
Being able to think outside the box is something I have always struggled with as I always rely on information I know to create something. Thanks to this blog I have been able to think outside the box and be more creative with the ways I will code, and think of solutions for my blog. At first I was confused on what I'll do as I didn't have much information to rely on but doing research through [The future of forensics: How AI can transform investigations](https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/news/ai-in-forensics/) I've been able to learn new ideas of technological advances I can create to solve problem modern forensic science has.

## Summary
In conclusion im very excited to create an idea for a technological advance in modern forensic science. Through this blog I will be able to further connect myself with coding, and technology and hopefully someday invent something in the field of forensic science.
