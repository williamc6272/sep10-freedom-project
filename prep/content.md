## Part A: Existing technology
* 1st google search "Existing technology within forensic science"
* 1st website I looked into [NIJ-Funded Software Tools, Apps, and Databases](https://nij.ojp.gov/library/nij-funded-software-tools-apps-and-databases)
  * After looking at this website I found other websites of diffirent examples of modern technological gadgets forensic science uses.
  * First website I looked into was [Device
Forensics](https://www.grierforensics.com/capabilities/device-forensics/)
      * This app shows a device that modern forensic scientists use
      * This technologic device is called a disk
      * The disk helpes scientists store important data
      * The disk stores valuable information that can be shared while the data is still actionable.
  * Second website I looked into was [What does the bone you are identifying most look like](https://boneidentification.com/about/)
      * This app is a morphological information tool to determine whether a bone is potentially human.
      * OsetoID also helps identify a bone if it is non-human, to which animal species does it belong.
      * This app is free to use for everyone on Windows, IOS and more!
      * App is mainly used by anthropologists, medico-legal death investigators, crime scene personnel, coroners, medical examiners, and law enforcement.
  * Third website I looked into was [CrimeStat: Spatial Statistics Program for the Analysis of Crime Incident Locations](https://frog.med.yale.edu/FrogKB/index.jsp](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/crimestat-spatial-statistics-program-analysis-crime-incident-locations)
     * App is used as a map for police departments and criminal justice
     * It calculates various spatial statistics and writes graphical objects to ArcGIS, MapInfo, Surfer for Windows and other GIS packages.
     * It is Windows hardware based only.
     * Can give police routes for easier navigation
* Other searches:
  * "Forensic Science most benefiting technologies"
    * [The interface between forensic science and technology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4581008/)
